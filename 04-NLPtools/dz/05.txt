Long short-term memory (LSTM)[1] network is a recurrent neural network (RNN), aimed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[2] present in traditional RNNs. Its relative insensitivity to gap length is its advantage over other RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods. It aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus "long short-term memory".[1] It is applicable to classification, processing and predicting data based on time series, such as in handwriting,[3] speech recognition,[4][5] machine translation,[6][7] speech activity detection,[8] robot control,[9][10] video games,[11][12] and healthcare.[13]

A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[14] and a forget gate.[15] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell. Forget gates decide what information to discard from a previous state by assigning a previous state, compared to a current input, a value between 0 and 1. A (rounded) value of 1 means to keep the information, and a value of 0 means to discard it. Input gates decide which pieces of new information to store in the current state, using the same system as forget gates. Output gates control which pieces of information in the current state to output by assigning a value from 0 to 1 to the information, considering the previous and current states. Selectively outputting relevant information from the current state allows the LSTM network to maintain useful, long-term dependencies to make predictions, both in current and future time-steps.
Motivation

In theory, classic (or "vanilla") RNNs can keep track of arbitrary long-term dependencies in the input sequences. The problem with vanilla RNNs is computational (or practical) in nature: when training a vanilla RNN using back-propagation, the long-term gradients which are back-propagated can "vanish" (that is, they can tend to zero) or "explode" (that is, they can tend to infinity),[2] because of the computations involved in the process, which use finite-precision numbers. RNNs using LSTM units partially solve the vanishing gradient problem, because LSTM units allow gradients to also flow unchanged. However, LSTM networks can still suffer from the exploding gradient problem.[16]

The intuition behind the LSTM architecture is to create an additional module in a neural network that learns when to remember and when to forget pertinent information.[15] In other words, the network effectively learns which information might be needed later on in a sequence and when that information is no longer needed. For instance, in the context of natural language processing, the network can learn grammatical dependencies.[17] An LSTM might process the sentence "Dave, as a result of his controversial claims, is now a pariah" by remembering the (statistically likely) grammatical gender and number of the subject Dave, note that this information is pertinent for the pronoun his and note that this information is no longer important after the verb is.
Variants

In the equations below, the lowercase variables represent vectors. Matrices W q {\displaystyle W_{q}} and U q {\displaystyle U_{q}} contain, respectively, the weights of the input and recurrent connections, where the subscript q {\displaystyle _{q}} can either be the input gate i i, output gate o o, the forget gate f f or the memory cell c c, depending on the activation being calculated. In this section, we are thus using a "vector notation". So, for example, c t ∈ R h {\displaystyle c_{t}\in \mathbb {R} ^{h}} is not just one unit of one LSTM cell, but contains h h LSTM cell's units.
LSTM with a forget gate

The compact forms of the equations for the forward pass of an LSTM cell with a forget gate are:[1][15]

    f t = σ g ( W f x t + U f h t − 1 + b f ) i t = σ g ( W i x t + U i h t − 1 + b i ) o t = σ g ( W o x t + U o h t − 1 + b o ) c ~ t = σ c ( W c x t + U c h t − 1 + b c ) c t = f t ⊙ c t − 1 + i t ⊙ c ~ t h t = o t ⊙ σ h ( c t ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f_{t}&=\sigma _{g}(W_{f}x_{t}+U_{f}h_{t-1}+b_{f})\\i_{t}&=\sigma _{g}(W_{i}x_{t}+U_{i}h_{t-1}+b_{i})\\o_{t}&=\sigma _{g}(W_{o}x_{t}+U_{o}h_{t-1}+b_{o})\\{\tilde {c}}_{t}&=\sigma _{c}(W_{c}x_{t}+U_{c}h_{t-1}+b_{c})\\c_{t}&=f_{t}\odot c_{t-1}+i_{t}\odot {\tilde {c}}_{t}\\h_{t}&=o_{t}\odot \sigma _{h}(c_{t})\end{aligned}}}

where the initial values are c 0 = 0 c_{0}=0 and h 0 = 0 {\displaystyle h_{0}=0} and the operator ⊙ \odot denotes the Hadamard product (element-wise product). The subscript t t indexes the time step.
Variables

    x t ∈ R d {\displaystyle x_{t}\in \mathbb {R} ^{d}}: input vector to the LSTM unit
    f t ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) h {\displaystyle f_{t}\in {(0,1)}^{h}}: forget gate's activation vector
    i t ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) h {\displaystyle i_{t}\in {(0,1)}^{h}}: input/update gate's activation vector
    o t ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) h {\displaystyle o_{t}\in {(0,1)}^{h}}: output gate's activation vector
    h t ∈ ( − 1 , 1 ) h {\displaystyle h_{t}\in {(-1,1)}^{h}}: hidden state vector also known as output vector of the LSTM unit
    c ~ t ∈ ( − 1 , 1 ) h {\displaystyle {\tilde {c}}_{t}\in {(-1,1)}^{h}}: cell input activation vector
    c t ∈ R h {\displaystyle c_{t}\in \mathbb {R} ^{h}}: cell state vector
    W ∈ R h × d {\displaystyle W\in \mathbb {R} ^{h\times d}}, U ∈ R h × h {\displaystyle U\in \mathbb {R} ^{h\times h}} and b ∈ R h {\displaystyle b\in \mathbb {R} ^{h}}: weight matrices and bias vector parameters which need to be learned during training

where the superscripts d d and h h refer to the number of input features and number of hidden units, respectively.
Activation functions

    σ g \sigma _{g}: sigmoid function.
    σ c \sigma_c: hyperbolic tangent function.
    σ h \sigma _{h}: hyperbolic tangent function or, as the peephole LSTM paper[18][19] suggests, σ h ( x ) = x {\displaystyle \sigma _{h}(x)=x}.

Peephole LSTM
A peephole LSTM unit with input (i.e. i i), output (i.e. o o), and forget (i.e. f f) gates

The figure on the right is a graphical representation of an LSTM unit with peephole connections (i.e. a peephole LSTM).[18][19] Peephole connections allow the gates to access the constant error carousel (CEC), whose activation is the cell state.[18] h t − 1 {\displaystyle h_{t-1}} is not used, c t − 1 {\displaystyle c_{t-1}} is used instead in most places.

    f t = σ g ( W f x t + U f c t − 1 + b f ) i t = σ g ( W i x t + U i c t − 1 + b i ) o t = σ g ( W o x t + U o c t − 1 + b o ) c t = f t ⊙ c t − 1 + i t ⊙ σ c ( W c x t + b c ) h t = o t ⊙ σ h ( c t ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f_{t}&=\sigma _{g}(W_{f}x_{t}+U_{f}c_{t-1}+b_{f})\\i_{t}&=\sigma _{g}(W_{i}x_{t}+U_{i}c_{t-1}+b_{i})\\o_{t}&=\sigma _{g}(W_{o}x_{t}+U_{o}c_{t-1}+b_{o})\\c_{t}&=f_{t}\odot c_{t-1}+i_{t}\odot \sigma _{c}(W_{c}x_{t}+b_{c})\\h_{t}&=o_{t}\odot \sigma _{h}(c_{t})\end{aligned}}}

Each of the gates can be thought as a "standard" neuron in a feed-forward (or multi-layer) neural network: that is, they compute an activation (using an activation function) of a weighted sum. i t , o t {\displaystyle i_{t},o_{t}} and f t f_{t} represent the activations of respectively the input, output and forget gates, at time step t t.

The 3 exit arrows from the memory cell c c to the 3 gates i , o {\displaystyle i,o} and f f represent the peephole connections. These peephole connections actually denote the contributions of the activation of the memory cell c c at time step t − 1 t-1, i.e. the contribution of c t − 1 {\displaystyle c_{t-1}} (and not c t {\displaystyle c_{t}}, as the picture may suggest). In other words, the gates i , o {\displaystyle i,o} and f f calculate their activations at time step t t (i.e., respectively, i t , o t {\displaystyle i_{t},o_{t}} and f t f_{t}) also considering the activation of the memory cell c c at time step t − 1 t-1, i.e. c t − 1 {\displaystyle c_{t-1}}.

The single left-to-right arrow exiting the memory cell is not a peephole connection and denotes c t {\displaystyle c_{t}}.

The little circles containing a × \times symbol represent an element-wise multiplication between its inputs. The big circles containing an S-like curve represent the application of a differentiable function (like the sigmoid function) to a weighted sum.
Peephole convolutional LSTM

Peephole convolutional LSTM.[20] The ∗ * denotes the convolution operator.

    f t = σ g ( W f ∗ x t + U f ∗ h t − 1 + V f ⊙ c t − 1 + b f ) i t = σ g ( W i ∗ x t + U i ∗ h t − 1 + V i ⊙ c t − 1 + b i ) c t = f t ⊙ c t − 1 + i t ⊙ σ c ( W c ∗ x t + U c ∗ h t − 1 + b c ) o t = σ g ( W o ∗ x t + U o ∗ h t − 1 + V o ⊙ c t + b o ) h t = o t ⊙ σ h ( c t ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}f_{t}&=\sigma _{g}(W_{f}*x_{t}+U_{f}*h_{t-1}+V_{f}\odot c_{t-1}+b_{f})\\i_{t}&=\sigma _{g}(W_{i}*x_{t}+U_{i}*h_{t-1}+V_{i}\odot c_{t-1}+b_{i})\\c_{t}&=f_{t}\odot c_{t-1}+i_{t}\odot \sigma _{c}(W_{c}*x_{t}+U_{c}*h_{t-1}+b_{c})\\o_{t}&=\sigma _{g}(W_{o}*x_{t}+U_{o}*h_{t-1}+V_{o}\odot c_{t}+b_{o})\\h_{t}&=o_{t}\odot \sigma _{h}(c_{t})\end{aligned}}}

Training

An RNN using LSTM units can be trained in a supervised fashion on a set of training sequences, using an optimization algorithm like gradient descent combined with backpropagation through time to compute the gradients needed during the optimization process, in order to change each weight of the LSTM network in proportion to the derivative of the error (at the output layer of the LSTM network) with respect to corresponding weight.

A problem with using gradient descent for standard RNNs is that error gradients vanish exponentially quickly with the size of the time lag between important events. This is due to lim n → ∞ W n = 0 {\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }W^{n}=0} if the spectral radius of W W is smaller than 1.[2][21]

However, with LSTM units, when error values are back-propagated from the output layer, the error remains in the LSTM unit's cell. This "error carousel" continuously feeds error back to each of the LSTM unit's gates, until they learn to cut off the value.
CTC score function

Many applications use stacks of LSTM RNNs[22] and train them by connectionist temporal classification (CTC)[23] to find an RNN weight matrix that maximizes the probability of the label sequences in a training set, given the corresponding input sequences. CTC achieves both alignment and recognition.
Alternatives

Sometimes, it can be advantageous to train (parts of) an LSTM by neuroevolution[24] or by policy gradient methods, especially when there is no "teacher" (that is, training labels).
Success

There have been several successful stories of training, in a non-supervised fashion, RNNs with LSTM units.

In 2018, Bill Gates called it a "huge milestone in advancing artificial intelligence" when bots developed by OpenAI were able to beat humans in the game of Dota 2.[11] OpenAI Five consists of five independent but coordinated neural networks. Each network is trained by a policy gradient method without supervising teacher and contains a single-layer, 1024-unit Long-Short-Term-Memory that sees the current game state and emits actions through several possible action heads.[11]

In 2018, OpenAI also trained a similar LSTM by policy gradients to control a human-like robot hand that manipulates physical objects with unprecedented dexterity.[10]

In 2019, DeepMind's program AlphaStar used a deep LSTM core to excel at the complex video game Starcraft II.[12] This was viewed as significant progress towards Artificial General Intelligence.[12]
